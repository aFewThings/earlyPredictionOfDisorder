## Summary
---
The PInSoRo Dataset (also called Freeplay Sandbox dataset) is a large (120 children, 45h+ of RGB-D video recordings), open-data dataset of child-child and child-robot social interactions. <br/>
These interactions are recorded during little-constrained free play episodes. They emcompass a rich and diverse set of social behaviours.

**PInSoRo is open-data, but they only provide the anonymised version for legal and ethical reasons.** <br/>
The anonymised version has `pinsoro-*.csv` files, but no raw video streams and ROS bag files that can be modified by presented tools.
Details is here: https://freeplay-sandbox.github.io/get-dataset

The PInSoRo Dataset consists in 75 recordings of interactions (45 child-child interactions; 30 child-robot interactions; up to 40 min per interactions). And each recordings has `pinsoro-*.csv` file containing facial features, skeletons, gaze, etc.
